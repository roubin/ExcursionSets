	volume = {423},
	issn = {0006-3002},
	abstract = {1. Techniques and experiments are described concerned with the millisecond kinetics of {EPT}-detectable changes brought about in cytochrome c oxidase by reduced cytochrome c and, after reduction with various agents, by reoxidation with O2 or ferricyanide. Some experiments in the presence of ligands are also reported. Light absorption was monitored by low-temperature reflectance spectroscopy. 2. In the rapid phase of reduction of cytochrome c oxidase by cytochrome c (less than 50 ms) approx. 0.5 electron equivalent per heme a is transferred mainly to the low-spin heme component of cytochrome c oxidase and partly to the {EPR}-detectable copper. In a slow phase (less than 1 s) the copper is reoxidized and high-spin ferric heme signals appear with a predominant rhombic component. Simultaneously the absorption band at 655 nm decreases and the Soret band at 444 nm appears between the split Soret band (442 and 447 nm) of reduced cytochrome a. 3. On reoxidation of reduced enzyme by oxygen all {EPR} and optical features are restored within 6 ms. On reoxidation by O2 in the presence of an excess of reduced cytochrome c, states can be observed where the low-spin heme and copper signals are largely absent but the absorption at 655 nm is maximal, indicating that the low-spin heme and copper components are at the substrate side and the component(s) represented in the 655 nm absorption at the O2 side of the system. On reoxidation with ferricyanide the 655 nm absorption is not readily restored but a ferric high-spin heme, represented by a strong rhombic signal, accumulates. 4. On reoxidation of partly reduced enzyme by oxygen, the rhombic high-spin signals disappear within 6 ms., whereas the axial signals disappear more slowly, indicating that these species are not in rapid equilibrium. Similar observations are made when partly reduced enzyme is mixed with {CO}. 5. The results of this and the accompanying paper are discussed and on this basis an assignment of the major {EPR} signals and of the 655 nm absorption is proposed, which in essence is that published previously (Hartzell, C.R., Hansen, R.E. and Beinert, H. (1973) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S. 70, 2477-2481). Both the low-spin (g=o; 2.2; 1.5) and slowly appearing high-spin (g=6; 2) signals are attributed to ferric cytochrome a, whereas the 655 nm absorption is thought to arise from ferric cytochrome a3, when it is present in a state of interaction with {EPR}-undectectable copper. Alternative possibilities and possible inconsistencies with this proposal are discussed.},

	abstract = {The ionic diffusivity of a concrete is a function of its microstructure at many length scales, ranging from nanometers to millimeters. The microstructure is largely controlled by the initial concrete mixture proportions and the ultimate curing conditions. Linking a property like ionic diffusivity to the microstructure then requires a multiscale approach. A multiscale microstructural computer model for ionic diffusivity has been previously developed. This model has been developed specifically to compute the chloride diffusivity of concretes with various mixture proportions and projected degrees of hydration. The three key parts of this model were dependent on large-scale supercomputer-magnitude simulations to: (1) determine the total volume of interfacial zones for a given aggregate distribution; (2) simulate the hydrated cement paste microstructure around a typical aggregate; and (3) compute the effect of the aggregates and interfacial zones on the overall diffusivity of the concrete. The key feature of this model is that one can approximately take into account the redistribution of cement paste between interfacial transition zone regions and bulk paste regions, and its important effect on overall concrete diffusivity. In the present article, we review the previously developed model and show how analytical equations can accurately replace the large scale computer simulations of parts (1) and (3). This accomplishment will make the model more usable by those who do not have access to supercomputer computing power.},

The method is numerically robust even for small samples, independent of statistical assumptions, and yields global as well as local morphological information. We illustrate the method by applying it to a Poisson process, a `double-Poisson' process, and to the Abell catalogue of galaxy clusters.},

Therefore, this projection provides possible links between the classical continuum strain-localization analysis and the non-linear (decohesive) fracture mechanics techniques. The strong discontinuity analysis shows that (bandwidth based) regularization of the hardening/softening parameter is the crucial modification to be done on the continuum model to achieve such a projection, and it also provides the strong discontinuity conditions that set restrictions on the stress state compatible with bifurcations in a strong discontinuity format. The methodology is illustrated on the basis of two classical families of non-linear constitutive models (scalar continuum damage and elasto-plasticity) for which the corresponding discrete constitutive models and the strong discontinuity conditions are derived.},

The treatment is comprehensive and self-contained, targeted at researchers and students in machine learning and applied statistics.

The book deals with the supervised-learning problem for both regression and classification, and includes detailed algorithms. A wide variety of covariance (kernel) functions are presented and their properties discussed. Model selection is discussed both from a Bayesian and a classical perspective. Many connections to other well-known techniques from machine learning and statistics are discussed, including support-vector machines, neural networks, splines, regularization networks, relevance vector machines and others. Theoretical issues including learning curves and the {PAC}-Bayesian framework are treated, and several approximation methods for learning with large datasets are discussed. The book contains illustrative examples and exercises, and code and datasets are available on the Web. Appendixes provide mathematical background and a discussion of Gaussian Markov processes.},

Upcoming high-resolution maps of the microwave background will allow detailed tests of Gaussianity down to small angular scales, providing a crucial test of inflation. We propose Minkowski functionals as a calculational tool for testing Gaussianity and characterizing deviations from it. We review the mathematical formalism of Minkowski functionals of random fields; for Gaussian fields the functionals can be calculated exactly. We then apply the results to pixelized maps, giving explicit expressions for calculating the functionals from maps as well as the Gaussian predictions, including corrections for map boundaries, pixel noise, and pixel size and shape. Variances of the functionals for Gaussian distributions are derived in terms of the map correlation function. Applications to microwave background maps are discussed.},

	abstract = {In this paper we consider probabilistic analogues of some classical integral geometric formulae: Weyl–Steiner tube formulae and the Chern–Federer kinematic fundamental formula. The probabilistic building blocks are smooth, real-valued random fields built up from i.i.d. copies of centered, unit-variance smooth Gaussian fields on a manifold \$M\$. Specifically, we consider random fields of the form \$f\_p=F(y\_1(p),...,y\_k(p))\$ for \$Fın C{\textasciicircum}2({\textbackslash}{mathbbR}{\textasciicircum}k;{\textbackslash}{mathbbR})\$ and \$(y\_1,...,y\_k)\$ a vector of \$C{\textasciicircum}2\$ i.i.d. centered, unit-variance Gaussian fields. The analogue of the Weyl–Steiner formula for such Gaussian-related fields involves a power series expansion for the Gaussian, rather than Lebesgue, volume of tubes: that is, power series expansions related to the marginal distribution of the field \$f\$. The formal expansions of the Gaussian volume of a tube are of independent geometric interest. As in the classical Weyl–Steiner formulae, the coefficients in these expansions show up in a kinematic formula for the expected Euler characteristic, \${\textbackslash}chi\$, of the excursion sets \$M{\textbackslash}cap f{\textasciicircum}-1[u,+ınfty)=M{\textbackslash}cap y{\textasciicircum}-1(F{\textasciicircum}-1[u,+ınfty))\$ of the field \$f\$. The motivation for studying the expected Euler characteristic comes from the well-known approximation \${\textbackslash}{mathbbP}[{\textbackslash}sup\_pın Mf(p){\textbackslash}geq u]{\textbackslash}simeq{\textbackslash}{mathbbE}[{\textbackslash}chi(f{\textasciicircum}-1[u,+ınfty))]\$.},

At the meso-level concrete is schematized as a three-phase material, consisting of aggregate particles, cement matrix and the bond zone, which separates these two phases. Displacement-controlled 3-point bending experiments are simulated varying the particle density Pk (Pk = 0\%, 15\%, 35\% and 55\%) and the specimen size, which is scaled in all three dimensions in a range of 1:8 (volume range 1:512), containing between 15,703 and 7,448,373 lattice elements. The numerical analyses show particle density dependent scaling behaviour of strength. For very low (0\%) and high (55\%) particle density, scaling comes close to classical Weibull theory; for intermediate densities a significantly different power emerges caused by stable pre-critical crack growth leading to hardening.},

	abstract = {A ribonuclease, purified 2500-fold from human liver, was found to be inactive against synthetic homopolynucleotides, whereas synthetic co-polymers containing adenylic acid were rapidly degraded. The specificity of the {RNase} is unique in that only purine residues, in a 5:4 ratio of guanylic to adenylic acid, are found at the 5' termini of the degradation products of yeast {RNA}. No specificity was observed at the 3' termini of the fragments. When analyzed by {DEAE}-cellulose chromatography, approximately 80\% of the oligonucletoides were 4 to 11 residues in length. The hydrolysis of {RNA} by the liver enzyme, when examined in low ionic strength buffer, could be increased severalfold over control levels by the addition of polyamines. The enzyme was found to exist as two distinct species on sucrose gradients, with molecular weights of 128,000 and 14,000. However, the addition of spermidine to the gradients resulted in the recovery of all the enzyme activity as the smaller species. The polyamines were also shown to reverse the inhibition of the enzyme by the ordered polynucleotides, polyguanylic acid and polyadenylic acid. Inhibition of enzyme activity by the polyadenylic acid segment of various mammalian {mRNAs} was also demonstrated.},

	abstract = {L'objectif principal de cette thèse est de développer un modèle numérique capable de proposer une représentation fine des phénomènes de fissuration pour les matériaux quasi-fragiles à matrice cimentaire. Dans ce sens, l'échelle pertinente retenue est l'échelle mesoscopique. L'échelle mesoscopique est ici de l'ordre du centimètre et le matériau peut être considéré comme bi-phasique (agrégats inclus dans un mortier, contenant lui même des inclusions de taille inférieure). Par ailleurs, de part la diversité des phénomènes de fissuration pour les matériaux quasi-fragiles comme le béton, il est nécessaire de mettre en place un modèle capable de représenter explicitement les fissures à l'interface agrégats/mortier et/ou dans n'importe quelles des deux phases (agrégats et mortier). La modélisation numérique des phénomènes de fissuration proposée s'inscrit, ici, dans le cadre de la méthode des éléments finis à discontinuité forte. Plus précisément, la fissure est ici définie comme l'apparition d'une discontinuité de déplacements ou encore d'une zone d'épaisseur nulle dans laquelle toutes les déformations sont localisées. Elle correspond au cas extrême des bandes de localisation observées dans les sols ou les roches avec une largeur des bandes tendant vers zéro. Par ailleurs, le modèle proposé intégre aussi une discontinuité faible (discontinuité de déformations) afin de capturer les hétérogénéités sans que le maillage soit contraint. Finalement le but est d'intégrer ce meso-modèle dans le cadre d'une approche multi-échelle séquencée permettant le transfert des informations du niveau mesoscopique vers le niveau macroscopique ou au moins sa borne inférieure, le Volume élémentaire Représentatif. Cette approche séquencée permet, par exemple, de déterminer une surface de rupture macroscopique (dans l'esprit d'une fonction seuil) intégrant les principales caractéristiques des matériaux cimentaires.},

Like the Davidon-Fletcher-Powell ({DFP}) variable-metric method, the new method preserves the positive-definiteness of the approximating matrix. Together with Greenstadt's method, the new method gives rise to a one-parameter family of variable-metric methods that includes the {DFP} and rank-one methods as special cases. It is equivalent to Broyden's one-parameter family [Math. Comp., v. 21, 1967, pp. 368-381]. Choices for the inverse of the weighting matrix in the variational approach are given that lead to the derivation of the {DFP} and rank-one methods directly.},

Circular dichroism measurements were employed as a measure of the base-stacking. The self-association of {ATP} is {pH} dependent with the protonation of the adenine ring helping stabilize the association. Highly charged counterions alter this aggregation. At {pH} 2.8 and 20 degrees C, a dimerization constant of 88 M-1 is obtained, while an isodesmic model leads to an equilibrium constant of 158 M-1. With increasing {pH}, the association constants decrease. At {pH} 2.8 there is a very strong temperature dependence of the {CD} amplitude. These results indicate the existence of additional electrostatic stabilization for the stacking of the adenine rings. At acidic {pHs}, models are proposed to explain this high degree of stability and a calculation of the approximate electrostatic contribution to the aggregation shows it to be of the proper magnitude.},

Neither the form (fibroblastoid or epithelial) nor the origin of cells influenced the type of the {CPE}. L cells and some cell lines derived from human tissue proved to be less sensitive to {PRV} than other cells.
